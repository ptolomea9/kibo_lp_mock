## Ad Copy Audit Summary

### Current Ads Issues Identified
1. **Missing DKI**: Gartner MQ ads, OMS ERP guide ad, Forrester ROI ad, B2B Migration ad lack DKI
2. **Low-Intent Landing Pages**: Many ads point to resource center (guides/reports) instead of product pages
3. **Generic DKI Defaults**: "Global OMS Platform" and "B2B Order Management System" used across different themes
4. **Weak CTAs**: "Download Guide" vs. action-oriented "Talk to Expert" or "Watch Demo"

### Recommended Fixes
1. Add DKI to all ads with theme-specific defaults
2. Update landing pages to high-intent product/solution pages
3. Customize DKI defaults for each ad group theme
4. Strengthen CTAs to focus on demo and expert consultation
